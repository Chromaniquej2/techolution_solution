# Library Management System

This is a simple Library Management System implemented in Python. It allows you to manage books and users, including adding, updating, deleting, listing, and searching by various attributes. The system also supports checking out and checking in books, tracking book availability, and logging operations.

## Features

- Manage books (add, update, delete, list, and search by various attributes like title, author, or ISBN)
- Manage users (add, update, delete, list, and search by attributes like name, user ID)
- Check out and check-in books
- Track book availability
- Simple logging of operations

## Design

The system is designed using Object-Oriented Design principles, with clear relationships and responsibilities among classes. The following classes are used:

- `Book`: Represents a book with attributes like title, author, and ISBN.
- `User`: Represents a user with attributes like name and user ID.
- `BookManager`: Manages books, including adding, updating, deleting, listing, and searching.
- `UserManager`: Manages users, including adding, updating, deleting, listing, and searching.
- `CheckInOut`: Handles checking out and checking in books.
- `Storage`: Provides file-based storage and retrieval using JSON.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Chromaniquej2/techolution_solution.git`

## Usage

1. Run the application: `python main.py`
2. Follow the prompts to interact with the system.

## Documentation

The code includes docstrings for classes and methods, and comments explaining complex logic or decisions.

## Error Handling

The code includes robust error handling to manage exceptions gracefully and validate user inputs.

## Pythonic Idioms and Features

The code uses Pythonic idioms and features, such as list comprehensions, generator expressions, context managers, decorators, and the use of standard library modules where appropriate.

## Design Patterns and Best Practices

The code follows best practices in software development, including the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, SOLID principles for OOP design, and effective state management.

## Scalability and Maintainability

The code is structured and written in a way that makes it easy to modify, extend, or refactor parts of the system without affecting others.
